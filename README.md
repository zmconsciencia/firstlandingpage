First time working on this page, completed the header in full, the spacing looks good, every button/link works just the way I wanted, my biggest problem so far as been some flex work and some html regarding the font im using and the image, but a brief google search and some trial and error got the header looking just the way I wanted.

Finished the project in full, no real problems other than specifying some elements. Happy with the end product.
